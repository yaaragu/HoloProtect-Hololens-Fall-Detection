# HoloProtect Fall Detection

HoloProtect was created during the AEC hackathon of 2017 in San Francisco with the goal of detecting falls using Hololens.

The Hololens app was built in Unity.

Currently the app works on a Unity simulation, but not once deployed to Hololens. You are welcome to make suggestions.
